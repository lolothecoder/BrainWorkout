Unicorn Hybrid Black Device Example - Real-time EEG Acquisition and Processing

This example demonstrates how to connect to and process real-time EEG data from
a g.tec Unicorn Hybrid Black amplifier system. It showcases EEG
signal processing with standard filtering techniques commonly used in clinical
and research BCI applications.

What this example shows:
- Real-time data acquisition from Unicorn Hybrid Black hardware
- Bandpass filtering for EEG frequency band selection
- Power line interference removal with notch filters
- Real-time visualization of EEG signals
- Hardware integration with g.Pype framework

Hardware requirements:
- g.tec Unicorn Hybrid Black EEG amplifier
- Windows operating system
- Unicorn Suite installed (including Python API)

Expected behavior:
When you run this example:
- Connects to Unicorn Hybrid Black amplifier automatically via Bluetooth
- Displays real-time EEG from 8 channels
- Shows filtered signals in real-time scope
- Amplitude range: ±50 µV (typical EEG range)
- Time window: 10 seconds of continuous data

Signal processing pipeline:
1. Raw EEG acquisition (8 channels, 250 Hz)
2. Bandpass filtering (1-30 Hz) - standard EEG band
3. 50 Hz notch filter - removes European power line noise
4. 60 Hz notch filter - removes American power line noise
5. Real-time visualization

Real-world applications:
- Mobile EEG monitoring and research
- BCI system development and testing
- Neurofeedback training applications
- Cognitive state monitoring research
- Consumer neurotechnology applications
- Attention and meditation training

Usage:
    1. Pair Unicorn Hybrid Black via Bluetooth
    2. Power on the device
    3. Run: python example_devices_hybrid_black.py
    4. Monitor real-time EEG signals

Note:
    This example provides the foundation for all BCI applications
    requiring real-time EEG data acquisition and processing with
    the Unicorn Hybrid Black wireless amplifier.
